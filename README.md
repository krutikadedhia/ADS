Advances in Data Science and Architecture - Final Project 

Introduction : 

We intend to make use of a largely and recently collected dataset of news popularity with over 39000 articles from Mashable website, to first select informative features and then analyze and compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms

Dataset :

Dataset gives details of each post which consists of 61 features. Details pertaining to posts on Mashable Website includes date, href details, positive/negative polarity of its over all post, sentimental polarity, title polarity, number of tokens in title, number of keywords, and so on. On analyzing the dataset, data cleaning was done wherever required, unwanted columns were deleted, new features were scraped and various machine learning algorithms were implemented with expanding to visualization in tableau.

Procedure :

1.	Data collection - Identify issues and/or opportunities for collecting data.
2.	Data cleansing.
3.	Data scraping - Scrape the data which was not available with original dataset which will help in useful analysis.
4.	Data organization - Make or convert data into machine readable format. 
5.	Feature Selection - Select most affected features for prediction, classification and clustering in Azure
6.	Data prediction - Perform prediction of number of shares for a given post and analyze results with using algorithms such as Two Class Decision Tree, Random Forest , Neural Network, and Poisson Regression.
7.	Data classification - Classify all the news into “High Popular” and “Less Popular” class based on inputs using classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Two Class Decision Tree and Neural Network classification.
8.	Data Clustering - Cluster the dataset into different clusters using K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms.
9.	Data Analysis
10.	Visualization
